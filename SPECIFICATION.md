## Technical Approach

**Static Site Generation**
- Build once, deploy everywhere
- No backend servers to maintain
- Data stored in JSON/Markdown files

**Recommended Stack:**
- Next.js (static export)
- Tailwind CSS
- Content in `/data` folder as JSON
- Deployed to Vercel or Netlify

**Data Management:**
- Edit JSON files directly or via simple admin script
- Rebuild and deploy on content changes
- No database required

**Search:**
- Client-side search with Fuse.js
- Fast enough for 500-1000 projects
- No external search service needed

---

## Design Direction

**Aesthetic:**
- Clean, professional, data-forward
- Dark mode by default (financial/tech feel)
- Dense but readable information display

**Key Principles:**
- Every page should load instantly
- Filtering should feel immediate
- Mobile-friendly but desktop-optimized

---

## Maintenance

**Adding a new company:**
1. Add entry to `data/projects.json`
2. Add logo to `public/logos/`
3. Rebuild and deploy

**Updating a company:**
1. Edit entry in `data/projects.json`
2. Rebuild and deploy

**No ongoing costs except:**
- Domain name
- Hosting (free tier sufficient)

---
