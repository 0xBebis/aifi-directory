Studies show ML models using these signals approve 20-30% more borrowers at the same loss rate as FICO-only underwriting, particularly benefiting the 73 million Americans with thin or no credit files."
      }
    ],
    "body": "Roughly 45 million Americans have no credit score at all. Another 28 million have files so thin that traditional scoring models can't generate a reliable number. That's 73 million adults, nearly a third of the credit-eligible population, locked out of mainstream lending by a system designed in the 1980s. The cost of this exclusion isn't abstract; it means higher-interest payday loans, denied apartment applications, and a persistent wealth gap that compounds across generations.\n\nThe FICO score, first introduced in 1989, was built for a different credit economy. It evaluates five factors: payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit inquiries, and credit mix. All of these are derived from bureau tradeline data, meaning you need to already have credit to get credit. The model is backward-looking by design; it tells lenders how someone managed debt in the past, not whether they can afford a new obligation today. For the millions of recent immigrants, young adults, and cash-preferring consumers who don't carry revolving debt, the FICO model has nothing to say.\n\nI don't think FICO is broken, exactly. For the population it was designed to score, it works reasonably well. But the assumption that bureau data is the only data worth scoring against has aged poorly.\n\n## What Alternative Data Actually Means\n\nThe term \"alternative data\" gets thrown around loosely, so it's worth being precise. In the context of credit underwriting, it refers to any signal not found in a traditional credit bureau file. The categories that matter most today are:\n\n**Bank transaction data.** Checking and savings account history, including income deposits, recurring expenses, overdraft frequency, and average daily balances. This is arguably the single most predictive alternative data source because it reflects real-time financial behavior rather than a lagging summary of credit usage.\n\n**Cash flow analysis.** A step beyond raw transaction data; this involves modeling income stability, expense volatility, and discretionary spending capacity. A borrower who earns $4,200 per month with steady direct deposits and $800 in discretionary surplus looks very different from someone with the same income arriving in irregular freelance payments.\n\n**Rent and utility payments.** On-time rent payments are among the strongest predictors of mortgage performance, yet they've historically been invisible to credit bureaus. Programs like Fannie Mae's positive rent payment reporting and Experian Boost have started to chip away at this gap, but ML-based underwriters were doing it years earlier.\n\n**Employment and income verification.** Real-time payroll connections through providers like Argyle or Pinwheel, replacing the old model of submitting pay stubs that may be weeks old by the time a loan closes.\n\n**Behavioral and device signals.** This is where it gets controversial. Some lenders look at how applicants interact with a loan application: time spent on each page, device type, typing patterns. The predictive value here is real but ethically fraught, and I expect regulators to draw harder lines around this category in the next two years.\n\n## The Companies Building This\n\n**Upstart** is the largest pure-play AI lending platform, publicly traded since late 2020. Their models ingest over 1,600 variables per application, including education, employment history, cost of living by geography, and hundreds of behavioral features in addition to traditional credit data. As of their most recent earnings, they've facilitated over $40 billion in loans across roughly 100 bank and credit union partners. Their approval rates run about 27% higher than traditional models at the same loss rate, according to their own published data. The asterisk here is that Upstart took heavy losses when rates spiked in 2022-2023, which tested whether their models were truly cycle-resilient or had been trained predominantly in a benign credit environment. They've since tightened their credit box and rebuilt. Whether the models hold through a full recession remains an open question.\n\n**Zest AI** has carved out a different niche. Rather than originating loans directly, they sell model-building software to credit unions and community banks. Their core pitch is explainability: every credit decision their models produce comes with reason codes that satisfy regulatory requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. For a 500-branch credit union that wants to modernize underwriting without rebuilding its compliance infrastructure, this is a practical offering. They claim their models reduce charge-offs by 20-30% while increasing approval rates, though independent verification of those numbers is limited.\n\n**Ocrolus** sits upstream of the decision itself. They specialize in document-level data extraction, parsing bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, and mortgage documents using a combination of OCR and ML classification. Lenders who want to underwrite based on bank statements need to first turn those PDFs into structured data, and doing that accurately at scale is a harder engineering problem than it sounds. Ocrolus processes millions of documents per month and feeds into the underwriting workflows of companies like Cross River Bank, Brex, and several large mortgage originators.\n\n**Petal** targets the thin-file consumer directly. They issue Visa credit cards underwritten primarily on cash flow data rather than credit scores. Applicants connect a bank account; Petal's models analyze income, spending patterns, and savings behavior to determine creditworthiness. It's a clean test case for whether cash-flow underwriting works at the consumer level, and their loss rates have reportedly tracked in line with traditional card issuers despite serving a population that would largely be declined by conventional scoring.\n\n**Heron Finance** focuses on the small business lending side, using open banking data to assess SME creditworthiness in markets where bureau data on businesses is sparse or unreliable. Their approach relies heavily on categorizing and analyzing business bank transactions to model revenue stability, supplier payment patterns, and cash reserves.\n\n## The Regulatory Overlay\n\nNone of this happens in a vacuum. The CFPB has been paying close attention to algorithmic lending since at least 2022, and the regulatory framework creates real constraints on what alternative data models can do.\n\nUnder ECOA and Regulation B, lenders must provide specific reasons when they deny credit or offer adverse terms. A traditional scorecard can point to \"insufficient credit history\" or \"high utilization ratio.\" An ML model that weights 1,600 features needs to produce similarly specific, actionable explanations. This is a genuine technical challenge; post-hoc explainability methods like SHAP values get you partway there, but translating a model's internal feature importance into consumer-facing adverse action notices that actually make sense is still more art than science.\n\nDisparate impact testing adds another layer. Even if a model doesn't use race, gender, or other protected characteristics as inputs, it can still produce discriminatory outcomes if its features correlate with protected classes. Zip code is the classic example, but subtler proxies exist in transaction data, device data, and educational history. The better AI lending companies run extensive disparate impact analyses and can demonstrate that their models reduce demographic disparities compared to FICO-only underwriting. But \"better than FICO\" is a low bar when FICO itself has well-documented scoring gaps across racial lines.\n\nI think the regulatory posture will tighten further. The CFPB's proposed rulemaking on automated valuation models and their broader interest in algorithmic accountability signal a direction of travel. Companies building alternative credit models today need to treat explainability and fairness testing not as compliance checkboxes but as core product requirements.\n\n## Where This Is Going\n\nThe trend line is clear; the question is speed of adoption.\n\nReal-time income verification is becoming table stakes. The days of uploading a PDF pay stub are numbered; lenders will connect directly to payroll systems and bank accounts and verify income in seconds rather than days. This collapses the underwriting timeline and opens the door to true instant lending at the point of sale.\n\nEmbedded lending is the distribution model that makes AI underwriting economically interesting at scale. When a SaaS platform, e-commerce checkout, or payroll provider can offer credit decisions in milliseconds using an API call to an AI underwriter, the total addressable market for alternative scoring expands dramatically. Shopify Capital, Square Loans, and Amazon Lending are early versions of this model, and all of them rely on proprietary transaction data rather than bureau scores.\n\nThe incumbents are moving faster than I expected. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Capital One have all made serious investments in ML-based underwriting over the past three years. When I first started covering this space, the conventional wisdom was that large banks would resist alternative data because of regulatory conservatism. That hasn't held. What's actually happening is that the big banks are adopting these tools internally while the fintechs compete on the edges of the credit box that traditional lenders still won't touch.\n\nThe question isn't whether ML-based credit scoring replaces FICO. FICO itself is adapting; FICO 10T incorporates trended data, and the company has partnered with alternative data providers. The real question is how quickly the lending industry shifts from \"credit score plus manual underwriting\" to \"real-time, multi-signal, continuously updated risk assessment.\" Based on what I'm seeing in the market today, that shift is about 60% complete for personal loans, maybe 30% for mortgages, and still early innings for small business lending. The next three years will close most of those gaps."

Man Group has published peer-reviewed research on RL for portfolio management. These firms use RL as one tool in a larger ensemble, not as standalone trading agents."
      }
    ],
    "body": "Most academic papers on reinforcement learning for trading are worthless in production. Strong claim. I'll back it up.\n\nThe typical setup: take historical OHLCV data, define a reward function based on portfolio returns, train a DQN or PPO agent, show a backtest equity curve that beats buy-and-hold. Sometimes the authors include transaction costs. Rarely do they model realistic slippage. Almost never do they account for the fact that their agent's own trades would move the market. The result is a paper that looks impressive on arxiv and falls apart the moment real capital touches it.\n\nThis doesn't mean RL is useless for trading. It means the applications that actually work in production look nothing like the academic literature.\n\n## Why RL Fits Trading in Theory\n\nThe theoretical appeal is legitimate. Trading is a sequential decision problem. At each timestep, an agent observes a state (market data, portfolio holdings, order book), takes an action (buy, sell, hold, adjust exposure), and receives a reward (P&L, risk-adjusted return, fill quality). The environment is partially observable and non-stationary. Rewards are delayed and noisy. Standard supervised learning struggles here because there's no clear label; the \"correct\" trade depends on everything that happens afterward.\n\nRL was designed for exactly this kind of problem. Markov decision processes, temporal difference learning, policy gradients: these frameworks handle sequential decisions under uncertainty with delayed feedback. On paper, perfect fit.\n\nIn practice, three domains have produced real results.\n\n## Where RL Works: Execution Optimization\n\nThis is the most proven use case. Not close.\n\nWhen a fund needs to sell $200 million of a mid-cap stock, it can't just dump a market order. That would crater the price. Execution algorithms slice the order into thousands of smaller trades spread over hours or days, balancing urgency against market impact.\n\nTraditional execution algos use heuristic schedules: TWAP (time-weighted average price), VWAP (volume-weighted average price), implementation shortfall minimization with fixed parameters. They work. But they're static. They don't adapt to intraday liquidity shifts, order book dynamics, or the specific microstructure of each stock.\n\nRL-based execution agents learn policies that minimize market impact dynamically. The state space includes current inventory remaining, time elapsed, recent price movement, bid-ask spread, and order book depth. The action space is how much to trade in each interval. The reward signal is execution cost relative to an arrival price benchmark.\n\nThis works for three reasons. First, the reward signal is clean and immediate: you know your fill price after each slice. Second, the environment is relatively stationary at the microstructure level; order book dynamics follow consistent patterns even as macro conditions shift. Third, the agent's actions are small relative to the market, so the simulation-to-live gap is manageable.\n\nJane Street and Citadel Securities both use RL-based execution systems. JPMorgan published LOXM, an RL execution agent, back in 2019. Virtu Financial has discussed ML-driven execution optimization in their public filings. This is not speculative. It's deployed.\n\n## Where RL Works: Portfolio Rebalancing\n\nDynamic asset allocation is the second area with real traction.\n\nThe problem: given a portfolio of N assets, how should you rebalance as market conditions change? Traditional approaches use mean-variance optimization with fixed rebalancing schedules (monthly, quarterly) and static constraints. RL agents can learn rebalancing policies that respond to current market conditions, volatility regimes, correlation shifts, momentum signals, and adjust allocations continuously.\n\nMan Group's AHL division has published multiple papers on RL for portfolio construction. Their research demonstrates that RL agents can learn transaction-cost-aware rebalancing policies that outperform fixed-schedule approaches, particularly in high-turnover strategies where trading costs eat heavily into returns.\n\nThe key insight: RL adds value here not by discovering alpha but by managing the mechanics of portfolio management more efficiently. When to trade, how much to trade, how to handle constraints. These are decisions where the sequential nature of the problem matters and where static rules leave money on the table.\n\n## Where RL Works: Market Making\n\nMarket makers provide liquidity by continuously quoting bid and ask prices. The core problem is inventory management: you want to earn the bid-ask spread, but you don't want to accumulate a large directional position that exposes you to adverse price moves.\n\nRL agents learn quoting policies that balance spread capture against inventory risk. The state includes current inventory, recent order flow, volatility, and order book imbalance. Actions are bid and ask price levels plus quantities. The reward function combines P&L with an inventory penalty term.\n\nThis works because market making is inherently sequential (each quote affects future inventory) and the feedback loop is tight (fills happen in milliseconds to seconds). Several proprietary trading firms use RL for at least some component of their market-making stack, though specific details are closely guarded.\n\n## Why End-to-End RL Trading Agents Fail\n\nNow the hard part. Why doesn't RL work for the thing everyone actually wants: an agent that decides what to buy and sell to generate alpha?\n\n**Non-stationarity.** Financial markets change regime. A policy learned during a low-volatility trending market will blow up during a correlation crisis. Unlike games (Go, Atari) where the rules are fixed, market dynamics shift fundamentally. A trained policy doesn't just become suboptimal; it becomes actively harmful.\n\n**Catastrophic forgetting.** When you retrain on recent data to handle regime changes, the agent forgets what it learned about previous regimes. Online learning methods help but don't solve this. You end up with an agent that's always optimized for the recent past, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\n**Sparse, noisy rewards.** In execution, you get feedback on every trade. In alpha generation, the signal-to-noise ratio of daily returns is abysmal. A strategy might have a Sharpe ratio of 1.5, excellent by any standard, and still have negative returns on 45% of trading days. Training an RL agent on this signal is like training a robot to walk in a room where the floor randomly tilts.\n\n**Transaction costs destroy theoretical edge.** An RL agent that discovers a pattern requiring frequent rebalancing might show beautiful backtested returns before costs. After realistic costs (commissions, spread, market impact, borrowing costs for shorts), the edge evaporates. The agent hasn't learned to trade; it's learned to overtrade.\n\n**Overfitting.** With enough parameters and enough history, an RL agent will find patterns in any dataset. Financial data has limited independent samples (daily data gives you maybe 250 observations per year), massive dimensionality, and heavy autocorrelation. The conditions for overfitting are near-perfect.\n\n## How Top Firms Actually Use RL\n\nThe firms making money don't build monolithic RL trading agents. They use RL as one tool in a large toolkit.\n\nTwo Sigma runs one of the largest systematic funds in the world with over 1,800 employees and roughly $60 billion in AUM. Their approach is data-first: massive infrastructure for ingesting, cleaning, and featurizing alternative data sets. ML models, including RL components, sit within an ensemble framework where no single model dominates.\n\nJane Street is primarily a market maker in bonds, ETFs, and options, trading around $21 billion notionally per day. Their edge is in pricing complex, illiquid instruments and managing the resulting inventory risk. RL fits naturally into their execution and inventory management stack.\n\nCitadel Securities, the market-making arm separate from the hedge fund, processes roughly 25% of all US equity volume. Their systematic approach to market making involves continuous optimization of quoting strategies where RL methods have clear applications.\n\nMan Group/AHL has been the most publicly transparent about RL research. Their published work covers RL for portfolio construction, execution, and trade scheduling. They frame RL as a way to improve existing systematic strategies, not replace them.\n\nWorldQuant takes a different approach entirely, crowdsourcing alpha signals from a global network of quantitative researchers. Their platform evaluates millions of alpha signals, and RL-style methods appear in their automated strategy combination and portfolio construction layers.\n\nNumerai runs a tournament where data scientists submit predictions on obfuscated financial data, staking cryptocurrency on their models. Some participants use RL-based approaches, and the tournament structure provides a natural testbed for RL methods with real economic incentives. It's an interesting experiment, though the obfuscated data means participants can't bring domain knowledge to bear.\n\n## The Actual State of Play\n\nThe hype cycle around RL in trading peaked around 2021-2022. Every fintech pitch deck mentioned reinforcement learning. Most of those companies are either dead or have quietly pivoted to more conventional ML approaches.\n\nWhat remains is a clearer picture of where RL adds genuine value. Execution optimization is mature and widely deployed. Market making applications are production-ready at firms with the engineering talent to build and maintain them. Portfolio rebalancing is promising, with Man Group's published results providing the strongest evidence base.\n\nFor alpha generation, the actual \"what to trade\" question, traditional ML methods remain more reliable. Gradient-boosted trees on well-engineered features, regularized linear models, even classical statistical methods like cointegration. These approaches are less flashy than a deep RL agent but more stable, more interpretable, and easier to debug when they fail.\n\nRL will continue gaining ground in execution and market making. These are natural fits where the theory matches the practical constraints. For the broader dream of an RL agent that just learns to trade from scratch, the fundamental obstacles, non-stationarity, sparse rewards, overfitting, aren't engineering problems with engineering solutions. They're structural features of financial markets. The sooner the quant community internalizes that, the sooner we can focus RL efforts where they actually produce results."

    "body": "At most banks, the anti-money laundering (AML) compliance team starts the morning the same way: staring at a queue of hundreds of transaction monitoring alerts, knowing that roughly 95 out of every 100 will turn out to be harmless. A restaurant owner deposits weekend cash receipts and trips the $10,000 currency transaction report (CTR) threshold. A freelance consultant receives a wire from a client in a high-risk jurisdiction. A retiree moves money between accounts at two different banks. Each of these generates an alert. Each requires a human analyst to open a case, review the customer's history, check for suspicious patterns, and write a disposition. The vast majority end the same way: closed, no suspicious activity found.\n\nThis isn't a minor inconvenience. The global banking industry spends an estimated $25 to $35 billion per year on AML compliance, and a large share of that cost goes toward investigating alerts that never should have been generated. In the United States alone, financial institutions filed over 4 million suspicious activity reports (SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in fiscal year 2023. The volume has been climbing steadily for a decade.\n\nThe question isn't whether the system is broken. Compliance officers already know it is. The question is whether machine learning can fix it without creating new risks that regulators won't accept.\n\n## How Rule-Based Monitoring Creates the Problem\n\nTraditional transaction monitoring systems operate on static rules. If a cash deposit exceeds $10,000, flag it. If a wire transfer goes to a country on a sanctions list, flag it. If a customer's monthly transaction volume exceeds three standard deviations from their peer group average, flag it. These rules were written to satisfy Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements, and they've barely changed since the early 2000s at many institutions.\n\nThe problem is that static thresholds don't account for context. A $15,000 cash deposit means something very different for a bodega owner than for a salaried accountant. But the rule doesn't know the difference. It fires for both. Multiply this across dozens of scenarios (structuring, rapid movement of funds, round-dollar wires, high-risk geography, politically exposed person (PEP) associations) and you get an alert queue that overwhelms even large compliance teams.\n\nBanks respond by hiring more analysts, which raises costs. Or they raise thresholds to reduce alert volumes, which risks missing real laundering activity and drawing regulatory criticism. It's a lose-lose configuration, and it's been the status quo for twenty years.\n\nThe false positive rate at most institutions sits between 95% and 99%. Some banks have reported rates above 99.5%. That means for every genuine suspicious case, analysts review 100 to 200 that aren't. The burnout rate among AML analysts is well-documented, and experienced compliance officers regularly cite alert fatigue as their top operational challenge.\n\n## What ML-Based Monitoring Actually Does Differently\n\nMachine learning-based AML monitoring doesn't throw out the rules. The better implementations layer ML on top of existing rule-based systems, or run both in parallel and use ML to prioritize which alerts analysts see first.\n\nThe core difference is behavioral baselining. Instead of comparing a transaction against a fixed dollar threshold, an ML model builds a profile of what's normal for each individual customer. It considers transaction history, account tenure, declared occupation, peer group behavior, and seasonal patterns. A $12,000 cash deposit from a customer who regularly deposits $8,000 to $15,000 in cash every Monday is scored very differently from the same deposit by a customer who's never deposited more than $500 in cash.\n\nNetwork analysis adds another layer. Graph-based models map relationships between accounts, entities, and transactions to identify suspicious patterns that no single-transaction rule would catch. Money laundering often involves layering funds through multiple intermediary accounts, and [graph analytics](/ai-types/graph-analytics) can detect these multi-hop patterns even when each individual transaction looks unremarkable.\n\nContextual scoring combines both approaches. Rather than a binary flag/don't-flag decision, the model assigns a risk score that reflects how anomalous a transaction is given everything the system knows about that customer and their network. Analysts see their queue ranked from highest to lowest risk, which means the genuinely suspicious cases rise to the top.\n\n## Companies Building ML-Based AML Tools\n\nSeveral companies have built products that address the false positive problem directly. They differ in approach, target market, and scope.\n\n**Feedzai** operates at the largest scale in this space. The company's real-time ML platform processes billions of transactions for some of the world's top-five banks by asset size. Feedzai's models run scoring at transaction time, meaning the risk assessment happens before the payment settles, not hours or days later in a batch process. Their system generates a risk score for each transaction and each customer interaction, which feeds into both real-time blocking decisions and downstream alert generation. For AML specifically, Feedzai's approach reduces false positives by contextualizing each transaction against the customer's full behavioral history. The company has disclosed that some clients have seen false positive reductions of 50% or more after deployment.\n\n**Hawk AI** takes a hybrid approach that's particularly well-suited to mid-tier European banks. Rather than replacing a bank's existing rule-based system, Hawk layers ML models on top of traditional monitoring output. Their cloud-native platform ingests alerts from legacy systems and re-scores them, effectively triaging the queue so analysts focus on the highest-risk cases first. For institutions that can't rip out their existing monitoring infrastructure (which is most of them, given regulatory expectations around system validation), this overlay approach reduces friction. Hawk has built a strong footprint among European banks subject to the EU's Anti-Money Laundering Directives.\n\n**Sardine** comes at the problem from a different angle: device intelligence and behavioral biometrics. Founded by former members of Revolut's compliance team, Sardine captures signals like typing speed, mouse movement patterns, and device fingerprints to assess whether a transaction is being initiated by the account holder or by someone else. This is more commonly associated with fraud detection, but the same signals are useful for AML. If a customer who normally logs in from a phone in Chicago suddenly initiates a large wire transfer from a desktop in a different country with different behavioral patterns, that's a signal worth investigating. Sardine's founders built the product after experiencing firsthand how thin the line is between fraud prevention and AML detection at a high-growth fintech.\n\n**Unit21** approaches the problem from the analyst's workbench. Their no-code platform lets compliance teams build, test, and deploy custom detection rules and ML models without writing code or waiting for a vendor's engineering team. This matters because AML typologies change. When criminals shift tactics, compliance teams need to adjust their detection logic quickly. Unit21's case management system also streamlines the investigation workflow, reducing the time analysts spend on each alert even when the alert volume stays constant.\n\n**Alloy** focuses on the identity verification and customer due diligence (CDD) side of AML compliance. Their platform automates the enhanced due diligence (EDD) workflows that banks run when onboarding higher-risk customers. By pulling data from multiple sources and applying ML-based risk scoring at the point of onboarding, Alloy aims to catch problems before they generate transaction monitoring alerts downstream. Preventing a bad actor from opening an account in the first place is, in some ways, more effective than trying to spot their transactions later.\n\n**Chainalysis** and **TRM Labs** address AML compliance for cryptocurrency transactions, which present a different set of challenges. Both companies provide blockchain analytics that trace the flow of funds across public ledgers. Chainalysis has become the dominant provider in this niche; its tools are used by government agencies including the IRS, FBI, and DEA, as well as by crypto exchanges meeting their BSA obligations. TRM Labs competes directly with Chainalysis, offering blockchain intelligence and transaction monitoring. As regulatory expectations around crypto AML have tightened, particularly after the collapse of FTX, both companies have seen demand grow. Their tools can identify when funds have passed through sanctioned wallets, mixing services, or darknet marketplaces. You can explore more companies working in this space in the [risk and compliance directory](/directory?segment=risk).\n\n## What Regulators Actually Think\n\nThe single biggest concern compliance officers raise about ML-based monitoring is whether regulators will accept it. The answer, increasingly, is yes.\n\nFinCEN issued a joint statement in 2018 with the federal banking regulators explicitly encouraging banks to consider \"innovative approaches\" to BSA/AML compliance, including artificial intelligence and machine learning. The statement noted that the agencies would not penalize banks for experimenting with new technologies, provided the bank maintained adequate risk management around the new tools. In 2022, FinCEN reiterated this position and specifically called out the potential for AI to improve the quality of SAR filings.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which sets international AML standards, published guidance in 2021 on the use of new technologies for AML/CFT (countering the financing of terrorism). The guidance was broadly supportive, noting that ML-based monitoring could reduce false positives, improve detection of complex laundering schemes, and allow compliance resources to focus on genuine risks.\n\nThat said, regulators expect explainability. A model that flags a transaction as suspicious needs to produce a reason that an analyst can evaluate and document. \"The model said so\" isn't sufficient for a SAR narrative. This is where some of the more opaque deep learning approaches run into trouble. Gradient-boosted trees and logistic regression models, which are more interpretable, tend to be easier to validate and defend during an examination.\n\nModel risk management is another concern. Banks subject to OCC guidance (SR 11-7 in the US) must validate ML models the same way they validate credit risk models. That means independent testing, ongoing monitoring for performance drift, and documented governance. Vendors that can support this validation process have an advantage over those that treat their models as black boxes.\n\n## What Compliance Teams Should Evaluate\n\nFor compliance officers considering ML-based monitoring tools, a few practical criteria matter more than marketing materials.\n\nFirst, ask about false positive reduction on a like-for-like basis. Some vendors measure reduction relative to the alerts their own system generates, not relative to the bank's existing system. A 70% reduction from an already-refined baseline is very different from a 70% reduction from a poorly tuned legacy system.\n\nSecond, ask how the system handles new typologies. AML patterns evolve. A model trained on historical SARs may miss emerging laundering techniques, particularly those involving cryptocurrency, trade-based laundering, or real estate. The system should support ongoing retraining and ideally allow compliance teams to inject subject-matter expertise into the model's feature set.\n\nThird, evaluate the investigation workflow. Alert quality is only half the problem. If analysts still spend 45 minutes per case navigating between six different screens to gather the information they need, the overall efficiency gain shrinks. Tools that combine detection with case management and SAR auto-drafting deliver more total value.\n\nFourth, understand the vendor's approach to model governance. Can they produce model validation documentation? Do they support challenger model testing? Can they demonstrate performance metrics (precision, recall, AUC) segmented by customer type and scenario?\n\nFinally, be realistic about timelines. Deploying ML-based AML monitoring at a regulated institution takes 6 to 18 months, depending on the bank's size, data readiness, and regulatory relationships. Quick wins are possible with alert prioritization overlays, but full model deployment requires data integration, validation, and regulatory communication.\n\nThe false positive problem in AML won't be solved overnight. But the tools exist now to make meaningful reductions in wasted analyst time while improving detection of actual suspicious activity. For compliance teams drowning in alerts, that's not a buzzword. It's an operational improvement that's long overdue."

        "question": "What is embedded lending?",
        "answer": "Embedded lending is credit offered inside non-financial products such as e-commerce checkouts, SaaS platforms, invoicing tools, and payroll systems. The borrower interacts with a merchant or platform, and the lending experience is integrated directly into that product.

      },
      {
        "question": "How do AI models make instant credit decisions at checkout?",
        "answer": "The AI stack works in four layers: real-time feature computation (pulling bank data, device signals, behavioral patterns in 50-100ms), pre-scoring (evaluating creditworthiness before the user clicks), a parallel fraud layer (device fingerprinting, velocity checks), and a decision engine that synthesizes all inputs into approve, decline, or counter-offer in under 200 milliseconds."
      }
    ],
    "body": "When a consumer taps \"Pay in 4\" at an online checkout, the lending decision behind that button happens in under 200 milliseconds. That's less time than it takes the browser to render the next page. In that window, the system pulls bank transaction data, computes dozens of features about the borrower's financial behavior, runs a fraud screen, scores creditworthiness, and returns an approve/decline decision with a specific credit limit. The consumer sees either a payment plan or a polite rejection. They don't see the infrastructure that made the decision, and until recently, most of the industry didn't either.\n\nEmbedded lending has become one of the fastest-growing segments in consumer and small business finance, and the AI systems running underneath it are more sophisticated than the simple \"buy now, pay later\" branding suggests. I've spent the past year tracking how the underwriting stack has evolved since the BNPL correction of 2022-2023, and what's emerged is a credit infrastructure that looks very different from traditional installment lending.\n\n## The Decision Stack in 200 Milliseconds\n\nThe AI behind an embedded lending decision isn't a single model. It's a pipeline of models running in sequence and in parallel, each handling a different part of the risk assessment.\n\nThe first stage is data ingestion and feature computation. When a borrower initiates a lending request, the system pulls real-time signals from multiple sources: bank account data (via open banking APIs or account linking), device fingerprints, behavioral signals from the browsing session, and any prior transaction history with the lender. This data has to be assembled and transformed into model-ready features in 50 to 100 milliseconds. The features themselves are things like average daily balance over the past 90 days, income regularity, recurring expense patterns, NSF (non-sufficient funds) frequency, and velocity of recent credit applications.\n\nRunning in parallel with the credit scoring is a fraud detection layer. This model evaluates whether the person making the request is who they claim to be and whether the transaction shows signs of fraud. Device intelligence, IP geolocation, behavioral biometrics, and velocity checks all feed into this score. If the fraud score exceeds a threshold, the transaction is declined regardless of creditworthiness.\n\nThe credit model itself is typically an ensemble; I've seen implementations using gradient-boosted decision trees trained on the lender's proprietary repayment data. The model outputs a probability of default, which maps to an approval decision and a credit limit. Some lenders run multiple model variants for different product types (pay-in-4 vs. longer-term installment loans) and select the appropriate offer based on the borrower's profile and the merchant's product configuration.\n\nThe entire pipeline returns a decision to the checkout interface, which presents the offer or the decline. From the borrower's perspective, it's instant. From an engineering perspective, it's a carefully orchestrated sequence of API calls, model inferences, and business logic running under hard latency constraints.\n\n## Consumer BNPL After the Correction\n\nThe buy now, pay later sector went through a painful recalibration in 2022 and 2023. After years of aggressive growth, several major BNPL providers reported rising charge-off rates as consumer spending shifted and interest rates climbed. Klarna, the largest pure-play BNPL company, saw its valuation drop from $45.6 billion in mid-2021 to $6.7 billion in a 2022 funding round before recovering to roughly $14.6 billion by mid-2024. The company processes $45.6 billion in gross merchandise value annually and serves over 150 million users globally, but the path to its 2024 IPO filing was shaped by the credit losses it absorbed during the correction.\n\nThe correction forced a shift in how BNPL lenders think about underwriting. Early BNPL models were relatively simple; some providers approved borrowers based on little more than an email address, a phone number, and a soft credit pull. The losses that followed were predictable in retrospect. What changed was the depth of data these lenders now use to make decisions. [Klarna's](/p/klarna) current underwriting stack incorporates open banking data, merchant-level transaction history, and real-time affordability assessments that go well beyond the traditional credit bureau score.\n\nThis matters because BNPL borrowers are disproportionately thin-file consumers; people with limited or no traditional credit history. A FICO score, if one exists at all, doesn't capture their financial behavior with much fidelity. Cash-flow underwriting, which evaluates a borrower's income and spending patterns from bank transaction data, provides a richer picture. The tradeoff is computational complexity: parsing months of bank transactions, categorizing each one, and computing meaningful features is significantly harder than pulling a three-digit score from a bureau.\n\nUpstart has been one of the most visible proponents of this approach. The company's models incorporate over 1,600 variables, including education and employment data, to predict default risk. Upstart argues that its models approve 27% more borrowers than traditional models at the same loss rate. Whether those numbers hold across economic cycles is still being tested; the company's charge-off rates rose during 2022-2023 alongside the rest of the industry, though they've since stabilized.\n\n## B2B Embedded Lending and Platform Credit\n\nThe consumer BNPL story gets most of the attention, but I think the more structurally interesting development is happening in B2B embedded lending, where platforms extend credit to their own merchants and sellers using proprietary transaction data.\n\nShopify Capital has disbursed over $5 billion in merchant cash advances and loans since launch, underwriting each offer based on the merchant's sales history on Shopify's platform. The data advantage is substantial: Shopify sees every transaction, every refund, every seasonal pattern in a merchant's business. A traditional lender evaluating the same merchant would need to collect tax returns, bank statements, and financial projections. Shopify already has the signal it needs.\n\nAmazon Lending operates on the same principle, extending credit to third-party sellers on its marketplace. Amazon's underwriting relies on seller performance metrics, sales velocity, inventory data, and customer reviews. The loans are repaid automatically through deductions from the seller's Amazon payouts, which reduces collection risk and simplifies servicing.\n\nStripe has built what I'd describe as lending-as-a-service infrastructure. Through Stripe Capital and its broader financial services platform, Stripe enables its business customers to offer credit products to their own users. The underlying data is transaction flow through Stripe's payment processing; authorization rates, average transaction values, chargeback rates, and revenue trends. Stripe's position in the payment stack gives it a data asset that's difficult for a standalone lender to replicate.\n\nWhat these platforms share is a structural information advantage. They don't need to ask borrowers to submit documentation because they already observe the borrower's economic activity in real time. The AI models they build on top of this data are trained on outcomes they can directly measure: did this merchant's sales grow after receiving capital, did repayment proceed on schedule, did the business churn from the platform? This closed feedback loop produces underwriting models that improve quickly with scale.\n\n## The Infrastructure Layer\n\nBehind many embedded lending products sits a layer of infrastructure companies that provide the plumbing: credit decisioning APIs, bank data aggregation, identity verification, and compliance automation.\n\nStripe's role here is dual. It's both a platform lender (through Stripe Capital) and an infrastructure provider that other companies build on. Its Treasury and Issuing products allow platforms to embed financial services, including lending, without building the regulatory and operational infrastructure from scratch.\n\nThe data aggregation layer is equally important. Companies like Plaid and MX provide the bank account connectivity that makes cash-flow underwriting possible. Without reliable access to transaction-level bank data, the entire real-time underwriting model falls apart. The quality and coverage of these data connections directly affects the accuracy of the credit models that depend on them.\n\nFor a broader view of the companies building in this space, the [lending segment of the directory](/directory?segment=lending) tracks over 40 companies across infrastructure, data, and application layers.\n\n## Regulatory Friction Points\n\nThe CFPB issued an interpretive rule in 2024 that treats BNPL providers as credit card issuers under Regulation Z. This means BNPL lenders must provide billing statements, allow consumers to dispute charges, and issue refunds for returned products in the same way credit card companies do. The rule adds compliance cost, but it also creates a clearer regulatory framework that larger players like Klarna and Affirm are better positioned to absorb than smaller competitors.\n\nState licensing is another friction point. In the US, lending is regulated at the state level, and embedded lenders need licenses in each state where they operate. Some platforms use bank partnerships to lend under a bank charter, which preempts state licensing requirements but introduces its own regulatory complexity. The OCC's \"true lender\" rule and related court challenges have created uncertainty about when a platform's bank partner is the \"true lender\" versus when the platform itself needs a license.\n\nFor B2B embedded lending, the regulatory picture is somewhat simpler. Merchant cash advances, which Shopify Capital primarily offers, aren't technically loans under most state laws; they're purchases of future receivables. This distinction matters because it means MCAs aren't subject to state usury caps or many consumer lending regulations. Whether this regulatory gap persists is an open question. Several states have introduced commercial lending disclosure requirements, and the trend is toward more oversight, not less.\n\nThe intersection of AI and lending regulation raises its own issues. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and fair lending laws require lenders to explain adverse actions, meaning they must tell declined applicants why they were declined. When the decision comes from an ML model with hundreds of input features, generating a clear and accurate adverse action reason is a non-trivial engineering problem. Some lenders use post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP values to identify the features most influential in each individual decision; others maintain simpler, more interpretable models specifically for the adverse action notice.\n\n## Where Embedded Lending Goes From Here\n\nI expect embedded lending to continue growing, but the growth rate will depend on credit performance through the current rate cycle more than on any technical advancement. The AI infrastructure is already capable of making sub-second credit decisions at scale. What remains uncertain is whether the models trained during a period of low interest rates and high consumer spending will perform well in a higher-rate, slower-growth environment.\n\nThe platforms with proprietary transaction data will have an advantage. Their models are trained on first-party behavioral signals that don't degrade the way third-party credit data can. But proprietary data also creates concentration risk: if a merchant's entire lending relationship depends on a single platform, the platform's underwriting decisions carry outsized influence over which businesses can access working capital.\n\nI'm watching three specific things over the next 12 to 18 months. First, charge-off rates at major BNPL providers through the rest of 2025; if they stabilize below 2022 peaks, it validates the underwriting improvements. Second, how the CFPB's BNPL rule affects smaller providers' unit economics once full compliance is required. Third, whether any of the B2B platform lenders disclose enough performance data to independently evaluate their underwriting quality; so far, most keep that data close.\n\nEmbedded lending isn't going to replace traditional bank lending. But for the segments of the market where speed matters, where borrowers are thin-file, and where the lender already has transaction data, the AI-driven embedded model is becoming the default. The question isn't whether it works. It's whether it works well enough, for long enough, across a full credit cycle."

    "body": "Most insurance underwriting still runs on self-reported data and paper forms. An applicant fills out a questionnaire, maybe attaches a photo, and an underwriter makes a judgment call. The process hasn't changed in decades. The data pipeline is thin, slow, and easy to game.\n\nThat's starting to break down. Automated data ingestion from satellite imagery, phone sensors, and internet-facing infrastructure now feeds risk models that price policies in seconds. The shift isn't theoretical. It's measurable in loss ratios, processing times, and customer acquisition costs.\n\nHere's what's actually working.\n\n## Computer vision in property insurance\n\nA single aerial image of a residential property contains more underwriting signal than a ten-page application form. Convolutional neural networks trained on labeled roof imagery can detect material type (asphalt shingle, tile, metal, flat membrane), estimate roof age within a two-year window, identify damage patterns from hail or wind, and flag structural features like skylights, solar panels, and swimming pools.\n\nNearmap captures high-resolution aerial imagery across the U.S. and Australia, refreshing coverage multiple times per year. Cape Analytics, acquired by Nearmap in 2023, built the ML layer on top. Their models classify roof condition on a four-point scale and estimate replacement cost from imagery alone. No physical inspection required.\n\nThe accuracy numbers are reasonable. Published validation studies show roof age estimates within two years of ground truth about 80% of the time. Material classification exceeds 90% accuracy on common types. That's not perfect, but it's better than asking a homeowner to guess when their roof was last replaced.\n\nWhat matters for underwriters: these models run at quote time. A consumer requests a homeowners quote online, the system geocodes the address, pulls the most recent aerial capture, runs inference, and returns property attributes in under three seconds. The old workflow involved scheduling an inspector, waiting days, and manually entering data. The cost difference is roughly $150 per inspection eliminated.\n\nHazard proximity analysis adds another layer. CV models combined with geospatial data can measure distance to wildfire vegetation, flood zones, and neighboring structures. Insurers writing in California wildfire zones now use vegetation encroachment scoring derived from satellite imagery to adjust premiums or decline coverage entirely.\n\n## Telematics in auto insurance\n\nUsage-based insurance (UBI) replaces demographic proxies with actual driving data. Instead of pricing a policy on age, zip code, and credit score, telematics captures what the driver actually does behind the wheel.\n\nThe data comes from two sources: OBD-II dongles plugged into the car's diagnostic port, or smartphone sensors. Phone-based telematics use accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to measure hard braking events, rapid acceleration, cornering force, speed relative to posted limits, time-of-day patterns, and total mileage. OBD-II adds engine diagnostics but requires hardware.\n\nProgressive's Snapshot program launched in 2011 and remains one of the largest UBI deployments. It started with a plug-in device and now offers an app-based option. Progressive reports that Snapshot participants who drive less and brake less save an average of $145 per year.\n\nRoot Insurance went further. Founded in 2015, Root underwrites primarily on telematics data collected during a test-drive period. The driver installs the app, drives normally for a few weeks, and Root's models score the driving behavior before issuing a quote. Root went public in 2020 and has had a rocky path since, but the underwriting model is directionally correct: price on behavior, not demographics.\n\nThe UBI market is growing at roughly 20% annually. By some estimates it will exceed $120 billion in gross written premium globally by 2030. The limiting factor isn't technology. It's consumer willingness to share data and regulatory frameworks that vary state by state.\n\nThe predictive ML models behind telematics scoring are gradient-boosted trees in most production systems. Neural networks haven't shown consistent lift over XGBoost-style models for tabular telematics features. The signal is in the features, not the model architecture.\n\n## Cyber risk scoring\n\nCyber insurance barely existed ten years ago. Now it's one of the fastest-growing lines, with U.S. direct written premium exceeding $7 billion in 2023. The underwriting challenge is unique: the risk surface changes weekly as software gets patched (or doesn't), employees click phishing links, and new vulnerabilities are disclosed.\n\nCoalition built its underwriting model around continuous external scanning. Before issuing a policy, Coalition's system scans the applicant's internet-facing infrastructure: open ports, SSL certificate hygiene, email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), known vulnerable software versions, and presence of credentials in breach databases. This produces a risk score that drives pricing.\n\nCoalition's gross written premium exceeded $520 million, making it one of the largest cyber-focused MGAs. The model works because cyber risk is observable from the outside. You don't need access to internal systems to see that a company is running an unpatched Exchange server or has an open RDP port on the public internet.\n\nThe feedback loop is tight. Coalition pushes security alerts to policyholders when new vulnerabilities are found in their stack. This active risk reduction is unusual in insurance. Most insurers don't try to prevent the thing they're insuring against. Coalition's claim is that active monitoring reduces claim frequency, which lets them price more aggressively.\n\n## Parametric insurance\n\nParametric policies pay out automatically when a measurable event crosses a predefined threshold. Wind speed exceeds 130 mph at a specific weather station. Earthquake magnitude exceeds 6.5 within 50 kilometers of the insured location. Rainfall drops below a defined level during a crop growing season.\n\nNo claims adjuster. No dispute over damage assessment. The trigger fires, and the payment transfers. The entire claims process collapses to a data lookup.\n\nAI models sit in two places in this chain. First, they set the trigger thresholds and price the coverage. This requires fitting extreme value distributions (generalized Pareto, GEV) to historical weather and seismic data, then simulating payout distributions under various trigger configurations. Second, they validate the event data in real time, cross-referencing multiple sensor sources to prevent false triggers.\n\nThe crypto and DeFi world has adopted parametric structures for protocol risk. [Risk Harbor](/p/risk-harbor) built parametric coverage for smart contract exploits and stablecoin de-pegs. If a covered protocol loses funds or a stablecoin drops below a threshold price on a specified oracle, the payout triggers automatically via smart contract. It's a small but interesting application of the parametric model to a risk category that traditional insurers won't touch.\n\n## Company profiles\n\n**Lemonade** launched in 2016 with a direct-to-consumer model for renters and homeowners insurance, later expanding to pet and life. The company runs on a claims bot (AI Jim) that handles first notice of loss and, in straightforward cases, approves payouts in seconds. Lemonade has reported processing claims in as little as three seconds, though that figure represents the best case, not the median.\n\nLemonade's revenue reached approximately $480 million in 2023. The company serves over two million customers across the U.S. and parts of Europe. Their underwriting model incorporates behavioral economics principles from co-founder Dan Ariely's academic work, though the specific ML techniques behind their risk selection remain proprietary. Loss ratios have improved but the company has not yet reached sustained profitability. The stock trades well below its 2021 IPO peak.\n\n**Next Insurance** focuses on small and medium business coverage: general liability, professional liability, workers' comp, and commercial auto. The company has raised over $1.1 billion in total funding and covers more than 500,000 businesses. Their pitch is speed. A small business owner can get a quote and bind a policy online in under ten minutes. The underwriting models pull data from public business registrations, review sites, and industry classification codes to assess risk without lengthy applications.\n\n**Coalition** is covered above in the cyber section. The combination of security monitoring and insurance underwriting in a single product is their differentiator. They've expanded into cyber and technology E&O coverage and now operate across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nYou can browse all insurance-focused companies in the [AIFI insurance directory](/directory?segment=insurance). For companies specifically using image analysis and visual data processing, see the [computer vision AI type](/ai-types/computer-vision).\n\n## What the data shows\n\nThe pattern across all four areas is the same: replace self-reported, static data with continuously observed, machine-readable data. Aerial imagery instead of homeowner questionnaires. Phone sensors instead of demographic proxies. Internet scans instead of security questionnaires. Weather stations instead of damage assessments.\n\nEach substitution makes underwriting faster, harder to game, and more granular. The models don't need to be perfect. They need to be better than the status quo, which in most insurance lines is a human reading a form and checking a box. That's a low bar. The companies succeeding here are the ones with proprietary data pipelines, not the ones with the fanciest model architectures."

        "question": "What is graph analytics in finance?",
        "answer": "Graph analytics models financial relationships as networks of nodes (accounts, people, companies) and edges (transactions, ownership links, shared addresses).

      },

        "question": "How does blockchain analytics use graph technology?",
        "answer": "Every blockchain transaction creates a public graph. Companies like Chainalysis and TRM Labs trace funds through wallet clusters, mixing services, exchanges, and decentralized protocols. They maintain attribution databases linking wallet addresses to known entities, enabling law enforcement and compliance teams to follow illicit funds from source to cash-out point."
      }
    ],
    "body": "Money laundering doesn't happen in isolation. It happens through networks: layered structures of bank accounts, shell companies, correspondent relationships, and intermediary actors spread across jurisdictions. A single suspicious transaction, viewed on its own, might look perfectly normal. It's only when you map how that transaction connects to hundreds of others that the laundering pattern becomes visible.\n\nFor decades, anti-money laundering (AML) systems have treated transactions as independent rows in a database. A wire transfer comes in. The system checks it against a set of rules: Is the amount above $10,000? Is the sender on a sanctions list? Does the transaction match a known typology? If a rule triggers, an alert fires and a human analyst investigates. This approach generates enormous volumes of false positives and misses sophisticated schemes entirely.\n\nGraph analytics offers a fundamentally different approach. Instead of evaluating each transaction in isolation, graph models represent the entire web of accounts, entities, and money flows as a connected structure. Patterns that are invisible in tabular data become obvious when you can see the shape of the network.\n\n## What tabular models miss\n\nConsider a simple example. Account A sends $9,500 to Account B. Account B splits the funds into three transfers of roughly $3,100 each, sending them to Accounts C, D, and E. Within 24 hours, all three accounts forward their balances to Account F. In a transaction-monitoring spreadsheet, each of these six transfers looks unremarkable. None exceeds reporting thresholds. None involves sanctioned parties. A rule-based system might flag none of them.\n\nIn a graph, the structure is immediately suspicious. The fan-out from B and the rapid convergence to F form a classic layering pattern. Community detection algorithms can identify this cluster automatically by measuring how densely interconnected a group of accounts is relative to their connections outside the group.\n\nThis isn't a hypothetical edge case. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has documented that layering through multiple intermediary accounts is the single most common money laundering technique across all jurisdictions surveyed. Rule-based systems were never designed to detect it because they don't model relationships at all.\n\n## Fraud ring detection\n\nThe first and most mature graph application in AML is fraud ring identification. Criminal organizations typically operate through clusters of accounts that transact heavily with each other, often in circular patterns designed to obscure the original source of funds.\n\nCommunity detection algorithms, such as the Louvain method or label propagation, partition a transaction graph into groups of tightly connected nodes. When a community of 15 accounts shows that 90% of their transaction volume stays within the group, and the accounts were all opened within the same two-week period at different branches, that's a signal worth investigating.\n\nThe math behind community detection is straightforward. The Louvain algorithm maximizes modularity, which measures the density of connections within communities compared to what you'd expect from a random graph with the same degree distribution. High modularity means the network has genuine cluster structure rather than random connectivity.\n\nBanks running graph-based community detection alongside traditional transaction monitoring have reported measurable reductions in false positive rates. Feedzai, which pioneered graph-based monitoring in traditional banking, processes more than 80 billion transactions per year across its client base. Their system builds transaction graphs in real time and applies both rule-based and ML-driven detection on the graph structure. The company reports that graph features improve detection rates by 40-60% compared to tabular-only models in published case studies.\n\n## Trade-based money laundering\n\nTrade-based money laundering (TBML) uses international trade to move value across borders. The techniques include over-invoicing, under-invoicing, multiple invoicing for the same shipment, and phantom shipments where no goods change hands at all.\n\nGraph analysis of trade networks can reveal these patterns. When Company X in Country A consistently sells goods to Company Y in Country B at prices three standard deviations above market rates, and Company Y is connected through shared ownership records to Company Z, which moves funds back to Country A through a different channel, the triangular structure becomes visible in the graph.\n\nCustoms and trade finance data form the basis for these graphs. Nodes represent companies, ports, and financial institutions. Edges represent trade documents, payments, and ownership relationships. Anomaly detection on this graph looks for pricing outliers, unusual trade corridors, and entity clusters with circular fund flows.\n\nThis area is less mature than transaction graph analysis. The data is harder to obtain, trade records are less standardized than bank transactions, and international cooperation adds friction. But several compliance technology vendors are building trade network analysis products, and FATF has specifically called out TBML as an area where advanced analytics should be applied.\n\n## Blockchain tracing\n\nPublic blockchains create a graph by default. Every Bitcoin or Ethereum transaction is a directed edge from one address (or set of addresses) to another, recorded permanently on a public ledger. This makes blockchain analytics a natural fit for graph-based investigation.\n\nThe challenge is attribution: linking pseudonymous blockchain addresses to real-world identities. Wallet clustering algorithms group addresses that are likely controlled by the same entity by analyzing transaction patterns such as co-spending (multiple inputs in a single transaction must come from the same controller) and change address detection.\n\n**Chainalysis** is the dominant player in this space. Founded in 2014, the company's Reactor product lets investigators trace funds across chains, through mixing services and DeFi protocols, and into centralized exchanges where identity is known through KYC records. Chainalysis is used by the IRS Criminal Investigation division, the FBI, Europol, and over a thousand financial institutions. The company reports more than one million users across government and private sector clients.\n\nTheir attribution database, which maps blockchain addresses to known entities, is their primary competitive advantage. Building this database required years of investigative partnerships, law enforcement collaborations, and analysis of exchange deposit patterns. It's not something a new entrant can replicate quickly.\n\n**TRM Labs** competes directly with Chainalysis in blockchain intelligence. TRM has raised more than $150 million in funding and provides multi-chain analytics covering Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and dozens of other networks. Their client list includes Binance and Circle. TRM's approach emphasizes real-time monitoring and cross-chain tracing, which matters as laundering increasingly involves \"chain hopping\" between different blockchains to obscure fund flows.\n\n## Companies building graph-based compliance tools\n\nBeyond Chainalysis and TRM Labs, several companies are applying graph techniques to financial crime detection across both traditional and crypto finance.\n\n**Feedzai** was mentioned above for transaction monitoring. The company, founded in Portugal in 2011, applies graph neural networks and more traditional graph algorithms to detect fraud and money laundering in banking transactions. Their client base includes several of the world's largest banks. Feedzai's system ingests transaction data, builds entity-relationship graphs, and runs both supervised and unsupervised models on graph features. Processing 80 billion-plus transactions per year puts them among the highest-throughput compliance analytics platforms.\n\n**Hawk AI** takes a hybrid approach combining machine learning with traditional rule-based AML monitoring. Based in Germany, Hawk AI serves European banks and payment providers. Their graph analysis module maps relationships between accounts, companies, and individuals, then applies anomaly detection to identify suspicious network structures. The hybrid model matters in regulated environments where supervisors expect to see explainable rules alongside ML outputs.\n\n**Sardine** focuses on fraud detection through network analysis of device and behavioral signals. Rather than analyzing fund flows alone, Sardine builds graphs from device fingerprints, behavioral biometrics (typing patterns, mouse movements), and transaction data. This catches fraud rings that share devices or exhibit coordinated behavioral patterns even when individual transactions look normal.\n\nFor a broader view of companies in compliance and risk technology, the [AIFI risk segment directory](/directory?segment=risk) lists firms across the category. The [graph analytics AI type page](/ai-types/graph-analytics) shows companies that specifically use graph-based methods.\n\n## The explainability problem\n\nRegulators are on board with advanced analytics in principle. FATF's 2021 guidance explicitly encourages the use of AI and machine learning in AML systems. FinCEN has issued similar supportive statements. But regulatory acceptance comes with conditions, and the biggest one is explainability.\n\nWhen a tabular model flags a transaction, explaining the decision is relatively simple: the amount exceeded a threshold, the counterparty matched a typology, the risk score was driven by three specific features. Model validation teams can audit feature importances and verify that the model behaves as expected.\n\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are harder to explain. A GNN might flag an account because of its structural position in the network: it sits between two suspicious communities, or its two-hop neighborhood contains an unusual concentration of recently opened accounts. Translating that into a suspicious activity report (SAR) narrative that a compliance officer can defend to an examiner is a real challenge.\n\nSome vendors address this by using graph features as inputs to interpretable models rather than running end-to-end GNNs. You compute graph metrics like degree centrality, PageRank, community membership, and transaction velocity within a subgraph, then feed those as features into a gradient-boosted tree or logistic regression. The graph structure informs the features, but the final decision model is interpretable.\n\nOthers are developing graph-specific explanation methods that highlight the subgraph most responsible for a prediction. This is an active area of research, and production-ready explainability for GNNs is still limited.\n\n## Where this stands today\n\nOnly about seven companies in the AIFI directory list graph analytics as a primary AI type. That number is low relative to the technique's potential. Most compliance technology vendors still rely primarily on tabular models with rule-based overlays. Graph-based approaches are gaining adoption but remain a specialty.\n\nThe companies seeing the most traction are those where graph structure is inherent in the data: blockchain analytics firms (where every transaction is a graph edge) and large-scale transaction monitoring platforms (where entity relationships naturally form networks). For trade finance and cross-border payments, graph analytics is earlier-stage but promising.\n\nCompliance teams evaluating graph-based tools should focus on three practical questions. First, can the system ingest your existing data formats without a year-long integration project? Second, does it produce alerts that your analysts can actually investigate and document for regulators? Third, does the vendor have validation evidence showing improved detection rates on data comparable to yours?\n\nThe technology works. The remaining barriers are integration complexity, regulatory model risk expectations, and the ongoing shortage of compliance analysts who understand both graph theory and AML regulations. Those barriers are real, but they're operational, not technical."

        "answer": "No. AI automates repetitive finance tasks like invoice matching, expense categorization, and bank reconciliation, and it improves forecasting accuracy. But strategic financial decisions require human judgment, and regulatory requirements like SOX mandate human oversight of financial reporting. The CFO role shifts from data wrangling to interpretation and strategy."
      }
    ],
    "body": "Enterprise finance accounts for 75 companies and $9.1 billion in combined funding in the [AIFI directory](/directory?segment=enterprise), making it the single largest segment we track. That concentration of capital tells you something about where buyers are spending; CFOs aren't chasing chatbots, they're writing checks for software that closes their books faster and catches errors before auditors do. I've spent the last six months mapping what I call the \"AI CFO stack,\" and the picture that emerges is less about any single breakthrough and more about a steady, methodical layering of machine learning into workflows that have run on spreadsheets and manual approvals for decades.\n\nThe stack has clear tiers. At the bottom sits accounts payable automation. Above that, expense management and corporate cards. Then treasury and cash management. Then FP&A, the planning and forecasting layer. And finally, payroll and HR finance, which touches every employee in the organization. Each tier has its own dynamics, its own incumbents, and its own version of the question every CFO is asking: where does ML actually reduce errors, and where is it just a marketing label?\n\n## Accounts payable: the $3 billion entry point\n\nAP automation is where most CFOs first encounter AI in their own department. The mechanics are straightforward: invoices arrive in varied formats (PDF, email, EDI, sometimes still paper), need to be captured, matched against purchase orders, coded to the correct GL account, routed for approval, and paid. Every step is a candidate for automation, and the market for AP automation software sits around $3 billion today with double-digit annual growth.\n\nStampli has built its product around the idea that invoice approval is a collaborative process, not a linear one. Their AI learns each organization's approval patterns over time, routing invoices to the right people based on vendor, amount, department, and historical behavior. The system flags exceptions rather than trying to handle everything autonomously, which matters in a finance context where a misrouted $500,000 invoice isn't just inconvenient; it's a control failure. Stampli's approach reflects a broader pattern I see across the stack: the most successful products augment human judgment rather than replacing it.\n\nTipalti takes a different angle, focusing on global payables. They automate payment execution across 196 countries, handling currency conversion, tax compliance, and fraud detection for over 4,000 companies. Their ML models score payment risk in real time and flag transactions that match known fraud patterns. For companies with large supplier networks spanning multiple countries, the value proposition isn't intelligence per se, it's the elimination of manual work that scales linearly with supplier count.\n\n## Expense management gets competitive\n\nThe corporate card and expense management space has become one of the most competitive corners of fintech. Ramp has crossed $300 million in ARR and is the fastest-growing corporate card in the US by most measures. Brex, which started as a card for startups, has shifted toward mid-market expense management. Both companies use ML in similar ways: real-time spend categorization, automated policy enforcement, and anomaly detection that flags unusual charges before they become audit findings.\n\nRamp's AI assistant is a good example of where LLMs are starting to show up in enterprise finance. It can auto-draft expense reports from receipt images, flag duplicate charges across employees, and surface spending patterns that a human reviewer would miss in a stack of line items. The underlying models aren't exotic. They're classification and matching algorithms trained on millions of transactions. But the product experience is genuinely different from the old workflow of filling out expense forms manually, and adoption rates reflect that.\n\nWhat's interesting about this tier is the speed of commoditization. Real-time categorization and duplicate detection were differentiators two years ago. Now they're table stakes. The competition has shifted to integration depth, how well these platforms connect to ERP systems, banking partners, and the rest of the CFO stack. That's a pattern worth watching across every tier.\n\n## Treasury and cash management\n\nTreasury sits at the center of the CFO stack, and [HighRadius](/p/highradius) has become the dominant AI-native player. Valued at over $1 billion with more than 800 enterprise customers, HighRadius automates the order-to-cash cycle and treasury management. Their ML-based cash forecasting models ingest historical cash flows, receivables aging, payment patterns, and macroeconomic indicators to produce forecasts that, according to their published case studies, reduce forecast variance by 30-40% compared to spreadsheet methods.\n\nThe cash forecasting use case is a clean fit for ML because it involves structured tabular data, clear feedback loops (you can compare the forecast to actual cash positions), and high business value. A 10% improvement in cash forecast accuracy directly reduces the amount of precautionary cash a company needs to hold, freeing working capital. For a large enterprise, that can mean tens of millions of dollars.\n\nKyriba operates in the same space with a SaaS treasury management platform used by large corporates and banks. Their product covers cash management, payments, risk management, and supply chain finance. The ML applications are more targeted: anomaly detection in bank statements, cash flow pattern recognition, and automated bank reconciliation. Treasury management is conservative by nature; treasurers are paid to avoid surprises, not to chase upside. That conservatism shapes how AI gets adopted here. Incremental accuracy gains matter. Flashy demos don't.\n\n## FP&A: the shift from Excel\n\nFinancial planning and analysis might be where the gap between current practice and ML potential is widest. Most FP&A teams still build their forecasting models in Excel, with manual data pulls, hardcoded assumptions, and version control that consists of filenames like \"Budget_v14_FINAL_revised_ACTUAL.xlsx.\" The shift to ML-enhanced forecasting platforms is real but slow, mostly because FP&A analysts have deep expertise in their company's business drivers and are understandably skeptical of black-box models.\n\nPigment and Vareto represent the new generation. Pigment offers a business planning platform where revenue forecasts, headcount plans, and scenario analyses are built on connected data models rather than disconnected spreadsheets. Their ML features focus on scenario generation (automatically surfacing the variables that most affect outcomes) and anomaly detection (flagging when actuals deviate from plan in unexpected ways). Vareto takes a similar approach with a focus on real-time variance analysis and collaborative planning.\n\nThe real challenge in FP&A isn't building a better model. It's getting the data into a state where any model can work. Most companies have financial data scattered across ERP systems, CRM platforms, HRIS tools, and dozens of spreadsheets maintained by individual analysts. The companies winning in this tier are the ones solving the data integration problem first and layering ML on top second.\n\n## Payroll and the platform play\n\nRippling sits at an interesting intersection. It combines HR, IT, and finance in a single platform, running over $12 billion in annual payroll. Their approach is to treat employee data as a unified graph: when someone is hired, their laptop is provisioned, their benefits are enrolled, their payroll is set up, and their expense card is issued, all from one system. The AI applications span the full surface area, from automated tax compliance (calculating withholdings across jurisdictions) to anomaly detection in payroll runs to intelligent routing of approval workflows.\n\nRippling's bet is that the CFO stack shouldn't be a stack at all. It should be a platform where finance, HR, and IT share a common data layer. If that thesis plays out, the standalone point solutions in each tier face pressure from platform players that can offer \"good enough\" functionality with better integration. It's too early to say whether that will happen, but the trajectory of Rippling's growth suggests the market is receptive.\n\n## What CFOs actually want\n\nI've spoken with several CFOs over the past quarter about their AI priorities, and the consensus is remarkably consistent. They want accuracy, not intelligence. Specifically, they want AI that reduces errors in reconciliation, speeds up the monthly and quarterly close process, and produces audit trails that satisfy SOX compliance requirements.\n\nSOX is the quiet constraint that shapes everything in this market. Section 404 requires that every material financial process has documented internal controls, and those controls need to be testable by external auditors. When an AI system makes a decision, whether it's approving an invoice, categorizing a transaction, or flagging an anomaly, that decision needs to be explainable and auditable. This requirement eliminates a lot of the more aggressive ML architectures and favors simpler, more interpretable models. Gradient boosted trees and logistic regression outperform neural networks in this context not because they're more accurate, but because auditors can understand them.\n\nThe other consistent theme is integration. CFOs don't want to buy six AI point solutions that each require their own implementation, training, and maintenance. They want their existing ERP system (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite) to get smarter, or they want a platform that replaces multiple tools at once. The vendors winning deals are the ones that can demonstrate value within existing workflows rather than requiring process redesign.\n\n## Where the stack goes from here\n\nI expect the next two years to bring consolidation. The AP automation tier is already seeing M&A activity, and the expense management space has more funded competitors than the market can sustain. The winners will be companies that have built proprietary data advantages, either through network effects (more transactions make the models better) or through deep integration with enterprise systems that creates switching costs.\n\nThe FP&A tier has the most room for growth, but it also faces the highest adoption barriers. Convincing a CFO to move forecasting out of Excel is a cultural change as much as a technology sale. The companies that crack this will likely do it by augmenting Excel rather than replacing it, meeting finance teams where they already work. As for the broader question of whether ML is reshaping enterprise finance, the answer is yes, but it's happening through thousands of small accuracy improvements and workflow automations rather than through any single dramatic shift. That's not the story most vendors want to tell. But it's the one the data supports."

They predict small, noisy signals. A good signal might have a Sharpe ratio of 0.3 on its own. Useless in isolation. Valuable when combined with 500 other signals in a portfolio construction framework that manages risk, correlation, and transaction costs simultaneously.\n\nThe distinction matters. Price prediction is a solved marketing problem and an unsolved research problem. Signal combination is an engineering problem, and engineering problems have tractable solutions.\n\n## The quant ML pipeline\n\nEvery serious quant firm runs some version of the same pipeline. The stages are consistent even when the implementations differ.\n\n**Data acquisition and engineering.** This is where most of the budget goes. Firms ingest traditional market data (prices, volumes, order book depth) alongside alternative data. Alternative data means satellite imagery of retail parking lots, credit card transaction panels from providers like Second Measure, container shipping records, web traffic estimates, app download counts, patent filings, job postings, and anything else that might contain a forward-looking signal about economic activity.\n\nRaw data is messy. Satellite images have clouds. Credit card panels have survivorship bias. Web scraping breaks when sites change layouts. The data engineering teams at top firms are larger than the research teams. That's by design.\n\n**Feature engineering.** This stage converts raw data into numerical features a model can consume. A parking lot satellite image becomes \"week-over-week change in estimated car count at Walmart locations in the Southeast US.\" A credit card panel becomes \"month-over-month spend growth in the restaurant category for consumers aged 25-40.\"\n\nDomain knowledge matters here more than ML sophistication. A physicist who understands signal processing will build better features from noisy time series than a deep learning expert who doesn't. This is why quant firms hire physicists.\n\n**Model training.** Gradient boosted trees (XGBoost, LightGBM) still dominate for structured tabular financial data. The reasons are practical: they handle missing values well, they're fast to train, they provide feature importance rankings, and they don't overfit as aggressively as neural networks on small financial datasets. Neural networks get used for unstructured data, NLP on earnings call transcripts, computer vision on satellite imagery, but the final signal combination step usually runs on tree-based models.\n\nOverfitting is the central danger. Financial data has low signal-to-noise ratio. A model that achieves 52% accuracy on historical equity returns is potentially very profitable. A model that achieves 65% accuracy is almost certainly overfit. Firms use walk-forward validation, synthetic data augmentation, and strict out-of-sample testing to manage this. Many promising models die at the validation stage. That's the process working correctly.\n\n**Portfolio construction.** Individual signals become portfolios through optimization. The optimizer takes hundreds of weak signals, each with estimated alpha, risk, and decay characteristics, and produces target portfolio weights subject to constraints: sector exposure limits, factor exposure limits, turnover limits, position size limits, and transaction cost estimates.\n\nThis step is where the math gets dense. Mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman models, risk parity, and various regularization techniques all appear. The portfolio construction layer is often more important than any individual signal. A mediocre signal in a good optimizer beats a strong signal in a naive portfolio.\n\n**Execution.** Orders need to reach the market without moving prices. Large firms use execution algorithms that split orders across time and venues to minimize market impact. Reinforcement learning has shown documented improvements here. Man Group/AHL published research showing RL-based execution reduced slippage by measurable amounts compared to traditional TWAP and VWAP algorithms.\n\n## The firms\n\n**[Two Sigma](/p/two-sigma).** About $60 billion in AUM. Around 1,800 employees, roughly half of whom are engineers and data scientists. Founded in 2001 by David Siegel and John Overdeck. They describe themselves as a technology company that happens to trade financial markets. Their data infrastructure is their moat. They invest heavily in proprietary data ingestion, storage, and processing systems. Their Venn platform open-sources some of their data science tools.\n\n**Jane Street.** Primarily a market maker, not a hedge fund. They trade bonds, ETFs, options, and other instruments, providing liquidity and earning the bid-ask spread. Daily notional trading volume exceeds $21 billion. About 2,500 employees. They write most of their production code in OCaml, a functional programming language rarely seen outside academia. Their interview process involves probability puzzles and mental math. They don't manage outside capital.\n\n**Citadel Securities.** Separate entity from Citadel the hedge fund, though both were founded by Ken Griffin. Citadel Securities handles roughly 25% of US equity volume. They're a market maker and execution firm, using ML for pricing, risk management, and order routing. The distinction between Citadel (hedge fund, ~$65B AUM) and Citadel Securities (market maker) is important and frequently confused.\n\n**Bridgewater Associates.** The largest hedge fund by AUM at over $120 billion. Founded by Ray Dalio in 1975. Their approach is systematic macro: they build models of how economies work and trade based on those models. \"Pure Alpha\" is their flagship strategy. \"All Weather\" is their risk parity strategy. Bridgewater's ML adoption has been more gradual than the tech-native firms. They've historically relied more on economic reasoning than statistical pattern recognition.\n\n**Man Group / AHL.** The most transparent quant firm when it comes to ML research. Their research team publishes papers regularly. Notable work includes RL for execution optimization, transfer learning across markets, and portfolio construction under transaction costs. AHL manages about $50 billion. Their willingness to publish gives outside researchers an unusual window into production quant ML.\n\n**WorldQuant.** Founded by Igor Tulchinsky, a former DE Shaw quant. WorldQuant's model is distinctive: they crowdsource alpha research from over 600 researchers globally. They evaluate millions of alpha signals through an automated backtesting platform. Individual signals are weak. The portfolio-level combination is where the value sits. This approach trades signal quality for signal quantity and diversity.\n\n**Numerai.** A hedge fund structured as a data science tournament. External participants build models on obfuscated data and stake cryptocurrency (NMR tokens) on their predictions. Numerai combines the best submissions into a meta-model that trades equities. It's an experiment in decentralized alpha generation. Whether it produces competitive risk-adjusted returns over long periods remains an open question. The structure is genuinely novel.\n\n**QuantConnect.** An open-source algorithmic trading platform with over 200,000 users. Their Lean engine lets individuals and small firms build, backtest, and deploy systematic strategies. They sit at the infrastructure layer rather than the fund layer. QuantConnect demonstrates how commoditized the tools have become. The tools aren't the bottleneck. The data and capital are.\n\n## Talent\n\nThe competition for quantitative researchers is intense. Top firms pay $400,000 or more as starting compensation for PhD graduates in math, physics, statistics, or computer science. Senior quant researchers at firms like Jane Street or Citadel can earn well into seven figures.\n\nFirms recruit heavily from a small set of programs: MIT, Stanford, Princeton, CMU, Caltech, Cambridge. The competition with big tech (Google, Meta, OpenAI) for the same talent pool is real and ongoing. Firms have responded by increasing compensation, offering more intellectually stimulating research problems, and, in some cases, allowing researchers to publish (Man Group being the clearest example).\n\nThe skillset has shifted. Twenty years ago, quant firms wanted financial engineers who could price derivatives. Now they want ML engineers who can build data pipelines and train models at scale. The financial knowledge is still necessary but no longer sufficient.\n\n## The alternative data arms race\n\nAlternative data is where the real competition happens. When every firm uses the same market data and similar models, the edge comes from having data nobody else has.\n\nSatellite imagery providers like Orbital Insight and Planet Labs sell data that quant firms use to estimate economic activity. How many cars are in Walmart's parking lots? How much crude oil is sitting in storage tanks? How many shipping containers are stacked at the Port of Shanghai? These measurements, updated daily or weekly from space, provide information that won't appear in official statistics for months.\n\nCredit card transaction data from providers like Second Measure and Earnest Research gives near-real-time revenue estimates for public companies. App usage data from Sensor Tower and Apptopia provides user engagement metrics before quarterly earnings reports. Web scraping captures pricing changes, job postings, product listings, and customer reviews across millions of sites.\n\nThe problem with alternative data is decay. Once a dataset becomes widely available, its alpha erodes. Satellite imagery of parking lots was a meaningful edge in 2015. By 2025, most major quant firms had access to the same providers. The arms race moves to newer, less commoditized data sources. Firms that can find and process novel data fastest win.\n\n## What this means\n\nThe quant industry runs on ML. That's not debatable. But the ML that matters looks nothing like the marketing. It's data cleaning pipelines, feature engineering by domain experts, gradient boosted trees on tabular data, and portfolio optimizers that combine hundreds of weak signals under risk constraints.\n\nThe firms that win do three things well: they acquire data others don't have, they hire researchers who can extract signals from that data, and they build infrastructure that lets those researchers iterate fast. Models are interchangeable. Data and talent are not. Anyone selling \"AI trading\" without a clear data advantage and a research team with quantitative credentials is selling something else."

    "body": "Opening a bank account shouldn't feel like applying for a security clearance. Yet for millions of people every year, the Know Your Customer (KYC) process still works the way it did in 2005: fill out a form, submit a photocopy of your driver's license, provide a utility bill proving your address, and wait. Three to five business days later, if everything checks out, you're approved. If a compliance officer flags something, expect weeks of back-and-forth for enhanced due diligence (EDD). The average cost per manual KYC review sits between $30 and $50, and for high-risk accounts requiring EDD, that figure can climb above $150.\n\nBanks don't love this process either. They spend an estimated $35 billion per year globally on KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions' annual survey. A large portion of that goes to human reviewers checking documents, cross-referencing sanctions lists from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), screening for politically exposed persons (PEPs), and filing suspicious activity reports (SARs) when something doesn't add up.\n\nThe bottleneck isn't laziness or bureaucracy. It's the sheer volume of data that Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance demands, combined with the manual workflows that have traditionally been the only reliable way to do it.\n\nThat's changing. AI-powered identity verification now handles the same process in under 10 seconds. Not all of it, and not without human oversight for edge cases, but enough of it to cut onboarding friction dramatically while improving detection rates for fraud and identity theft.\n\n## How the old process works\n\nA quick sketch of what \"manual KYC\" actually means, because the term gets thrown around loosely.\n\nWhen a customer applies for a new account, the financial institution must verify their identity under the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rule finalized by FinCEN in 2016. That means confirming four pieces of information: name, date of birth, address, and an identification number (typically a Social Security number for US persons, or a passport number for non-US persons). The institution also has to identify and verify beneficial owners of legal entity customers who own 25% or more of the entity.\n\nIn practice, a compliance analyst receives the application, reviews the submitted documents, checks the customer's name against OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, screens for PEP status, and assigns a risk rating. Low-risk customers pass through relatively quickly. High-risk customers (those from sanctioned jurisdictions, PEPs, businesses in cash-intensive industries) trigger EDD, which means deeper investigation into the source of funds, the nature of the business relationship, and ongoing monitoring obligations.\n\nThis process, repeated millions of times per year across the banking system, is where AI identity verification delivers its most measurable improvement.\n\n## Three pillars of AI identity verification\n\nModern AI-powered KYC doesn't replace the compliance framework. It automates the data extraction, document authentication, and identity matching steps that consume the bulk of analyst time. The technology breaks into three layers.\n\n**Document AI** uses optical character recognition (OCR) paired with computer vision models to read, authenticate, and extract structured data from identity documents. The leading platforms support 6,000+ document types across 200+ countries. But reading the document is the easy part. Authentication is where the AI earns its keep: analyzing micro-print patterns, hologram placement, font consistency, and security feature positioning to detect forgeries. A skilled forger can fool a human reviewer looking at a scanned image. Fooling a model trained on millions of authentic documents is harder, because the model detects pixel-level inconsistencies that no human eye would catch.\n\n**Biometric matching** compares a live selfie captured during onboarding to the photo on the submitted ID document. The technical challenge here isn't the comparison itself; it's liveness detection. Fraudsters have tried holding up printed photos, playing videos on screens, wearing 3D-printed masks, and more recently, using deepfake video feeds. Modern liveness detection uses 3D depth analysis from smartphone cameras, randomized challenge-response prompts (turn your head left, blink twice), and texture analysis to distinguish living skin from reproductions.\n\n**Device and behavioral intelligence** adds a third signal layer that operates before the customer even submits a document. Device fingerprinting catalogs hundreds of attributes about the device being used: operating system version, screen resolution, installed fonts, battery level, whether the device is rooted or jailbroken. IP reputation scoring flags connections from known proxy services, data centers, or geographies associated with fraud rings. Behavioral signals like typing cadence, mouse movement patterns, and session navigation behavior build a risk profile in real time.\n\n## The companies building this\n\nSix companies stand out for the scope and maturity of their AI identity verification offerings.\n\n**Socure** has built what it calls a predictive analytics platform for identity verification and fraud prevention, anchored by a graph-based identity network that analyzes over 300 million identity records. The company serves more than 1,800 customers, including four of the five largest US banks. Socure claims a 95%+ auto-approval rate for legitimate customers, meaning only a small fraction require manual review. The graph-based approach is what differentiates Socure: rather than evaluating each identity in isolation, the system maps relationships between identities, devices, and behaviors to detect synthetic identity fraud (where a criminal assembles a fake identity from real and fabricated data elements).\n\n**Persona** takes an infrastructure approach, providing an API-first platform that lets companies build modular verification flows. Its customer list includes Block (formerly Square), DoorDash, and Coursera. Persona's design philosophy treats identity verification as a composable pipeline: a company can chain together document verification, database checks, watchlist screening, and biometric matching in whatever order and combination fits their risk appetite. This flexibility has made Persona popular with fintech companies that need to balance conversion rates against compliance requirements.\n\n**Onfido**, based in the UK, focused on AI-powered document and biometric verification and grew to serve over 1,200 customers before being acquired by Entrust for more than $400 million. The acquisition signaled something important about the market: identity verification is converging with broader digital identity infrastructure, including certificate authorities, PKI, and credentialing systems.\n\n**Jumio** pioneered the selfie-based ID verification model that's now standard across the industry. The company has processed over 300 million verifications across 200 countries, giving it one of the largest training datasets for document and biometric AI models. Scale matters here because document fraud techniques vary by country and document type, and a model trained on a narrow dataset will miss region-specific forgery patterns.\n\n**Alloy** approaches the problem differently. Rather than building its own verification AI, Alloy serves as an identity decisioning platform that connects multiple verification vendors into a single orchestration workflow. A bank using Alloy can route an application through Socure for identity scoring, Jumio for document verification, and a bureau check from Experian, all through one API integration. Brex, Marqeta, and Ally Bank use this approach. The value proposition is that no single vendor catches everything, and Alloy lets institutions layer defenses without building custom integrations for each one.\n\n**Sardine** brings a distinctive angle: device intelligence as the first line of defense. Founded by former Revolut compliance leaders who saw firsthand how device and behavioral signals could flag fraud before any document was submitted, Sardine generates risk scores based on device fingerprinting and behavioral biometrics. The insight is that a fraudster using a stolen identity will still exhibit device and behavioral patterns that differ from the legitimate account holder. Sardine's scores feed into downstream decisioning, meaning high-risk sessions can be routed to additional verification steps while low-risk sessions proceed with minimal friction.\n\nFor a broader view of companies working on compliance and risk technology, the [AIFI risk segment directory](/directory?segment=risk) tracks dozens of firms across the space.\n\n## Bias and fairness remain unsolved\n\nNo discussion of AI identity verification is honest without addressing bias. Facial recognition accuracy varies by skin tone, ethnicity, and age. Studies by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have documented false positive rates that are 10 to 100 times higher for certain demographic groups compared to others. In a KYC context, a false positive means a legitimate customer is flagged for additional review or rejected outright, which translates to discriminatory friction in account opening.\n\nCompanies are aware of the problem. Socure has published demographic fairness testing results. Onfido has released bias audits for its facial matching algorithms. But awareness and published results aren't the same as a solved problem.\n\nRegulators are paying attention. The CFPB has signaled interest in how AI-driven adverse actions affect protected classes. The EU's AI Act classifies biometric identification as high-risk, subjecting it to mandatory conformity assessments and ongoing monitoring requirements. Financial institutions deploying these systems carry model risk management obligations under SR 11-7 (the Fed's guidance on model risk), which means they need to validate that the AI performs fairly across demographic groups, not just accurately on average.\n\nThe companies that invest in [computer vision AI](/ai-types/computer-vision) for identity verification will need to treat fairness testing as a continuous practice, not a one-time audit.\n\n## Regulators are warming up, carefully\n\nThe regulatory trajectory is toward accepting AI-assisted identity verification, but with conditions.\n\nFinCEN's CDD rule doesn't prescribe how identity verification must be performed. It requires that institutions form a \"reasonable belief\" that they know the true identity of their customers. AI verification satisfies this standard when implemented with appropriate human oversight and exception handling.\n\nIn Europe, the eIDAS 2.0 regulation is pushing toward standardized digital identity wallets that EU citizens can use across borders and services. Once these wallets are widely adopted, KYC verification could become a one-time event: verify your identity once, receive a reusable digital credential, present that credential to new financial institutions without repeating the process. This represents a structural shift from repeated point-in-time verification to portable, persistent digital identity.\n\nThe UK's Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework takes a similar approach, establishing standards for organizations that want to provide digital identity services. The framework defines levels of confidence, certification requirements, and interoperability standards.\n\nFor US institutions, the practical question is whether regulators will accept fully automated KYC decisions without human review. Today, most implementations use AI to auto-approve low-risk applications and route medium and high-risk cases to human analysts. Full automation of the decision (not just the data extraction) remains a frontier that regulators haven't explicitly blessed.\n\n## Practical recommendations\n\nFor institutions evaluating AI identity verification, five considerations matter most.\n\nFirst, measure false rejection rates by demographic group before deployment. An auto-approval rate of 95% means nothing if the 5% being rejected skews toward specific populations.\n\nSecond, treat the AI as one input into a decisioning framework, not as the decision itself. Alloy's orchestration approach reflects this principle: layer multiple signals and vendors rather than relying on a single model.\n\nThird, maintain fallback workflows. When the AI can't make a determination (poor image quality, unsupported document types, liveness check failures), a human review path must exist and must be fast enough that customers don't abandon the process.\n\nFourth, document everything for exam readiness. Regulators will want to see model validation results, bias testing, exception handling procedures, and audit trails of automated decisions. SR 11-7 compliance isn't optional.\n\nFifth, plan for digital identity convergence. The eIDAS 2.0 wallets, the UK's trust framework, and eventual US standardization efforts will change the verification model from \"check documents every time\" to \"verify a credential once.\" Institutions that build rigid, document-only verification pipelines will need to rebuild when portable digital identity arrives.\n\nThe improvement over the old model is real and measurable: faster onboarding, lower cost per verification, higher fraud detection rates. But AI identity verification is a tool upgrade, not a compliance shortcut. The regulatory obligations remain the same. The technology just makes meeting them faster and, when implemented carefully, more fair."

    "body": "DeFi protocols lost $3.8 billion to exploits and attacks in 2023. That was actually an improvement over the $5+ billion lost in 2022, but the number still dwarfs what any traditional financial institution would tolerate as an annual loss figure. What makes the problem stubborn is that most of these losses didn't come from the kind of bugs that code audits are designed to catch. They came from economic design flaws: situations where a protocol's incentive structure, market assumptions, or parameter settings created an exploitable condition under specific market stress.\n\nSmart contract audits are necessary but insufficient. An audit confirms that the code does what the specification says. It doesn't tell you what happens when ETH drops 40% in six hours, gas prices spike to 500 gwei, and three large liquidation bots go offline simultaneously. That kind of failure mode lives in the interaction between the protocol's economic design and real market dynamics, and catching it requires a different class of analysis.\n\nThis is where AI-driven risk management for DeFi has developed into a real discipline, not a marketing label.\n\n## The risk taxonomy\n\nBefore getting into the technology, it's worth being precise about what kinds of risk DeFi protocols face, because different risk types require different mitigation strategies.\n\n**Code vulnerabilities** are the most understood category. Reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, flash loan exploits that take advantage of unprotected function calls. These are software bugs, and the traditional defense is a code audit performed by firms like Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, or Consensys Diligence. Static analysis tools and formal verification methods have improved substantially over the past three years. Code-level exploits still happen, but they're becoming less common relative to other attack vectors.\n\n**Economic design flaws** are the category that AI risk management addresses most directly. Oracle manipulation attacks, where an attacker distorts the price feed that a lending protocol uses to determine collateral values, and then borrows against inflated collateral. Governance attacks, where someone acquires enough voting power to push through a malicious parameter change. Liquidation cascades, where a market downturn triggers a wave of liquidations that themselves push prices lower, triggering more liquidations in a feedback loop. These aren't code bugs; they're emergent behaviors of complex systems under stress.\n\n**Operational risks** sit in a third category: admin key compromises, bridge exploits, and social engineering attacks against multisig holders. These are infrastructure and process failures rather than protocol design failures, and they require different mitigations (hardware wallets, timelocks, distributed key management) that fall outside the scope of economic simulation.\n\nThe first category gets audited. The third category gets addressed through operational security practices. The second category is where AI simulation and modeling earn their place.\n\n## Agent-based simulation as a core technique\n\nThe dominant approach to AI-driven DeFi risk management is agent-based simulation, and it's worth understanding the mechanics because the technique is more rigorous than it might sound.\n\nThe process starts with building a simulated environment that mirrors the protocol's smart contract logic. Not a simplified model of the protocol; an actual representation of its state transitions, parameter settings, and interaction patterns. Into this environment, the platform deploys thousands of autonomous agents, each programmed to represent a different user archetype. Some agents are arbitrageurs who will exploit any price discrepancy between venues. Some are liquidators who monitor undercollateralized positions and compete to liquidate them. Some are whale depositors who move large amounts of capital in and out based on yield differentials. Some are adversarial agents specifically designed to find profitable attack strategies.\n\nThe simulation then runs millions of scenarios, each with different market conditions. What happens if ETH drops 50% in an hour? What if the USDC peg wobbles to $0.97? What if the Chainlink oracle delays by 30 seconds during a period of high volatility? What if gas prices make liquidation transactions uneconomical? For each scenario, the system measures protocol health metrics: the amount of bad debt generated, liquidation efficiency (what percentage of undercollateralized positions were actually liquidated), utilization rates, and whether any agent found a profitable exploit.\n\nThe output isn't a single risk score. It's a distribution of outcomes across market conditions, which can be used to set protocol parameters (collateral factors, liquidation bonuses, borrow caps, interest rate curve shapes) at levels that keep the protocol solvent across the tested range of conditions.\n\nI want to be clear about what this is and isn't. It's a form of stress testing adapted for on-chain protocols. It isn't a guarantee against novel attack vectors, and it's only as good as the scenarios and agent behaviors the modelers design. But it represents a substantial upgrade over the alternative, which is setting parameters based on intuition and adjusting them reactively after losses occur.\n\n## The companies doing the work\n\nFour firms have established meaningful positions in DeFi risk management, though they approach the problem from different angles.\n\n**Gauntlet** is, by most measures, the leading dedicated DeFi risk platform. The company runs agent-based simulations against protocol smart contract logic and has become the risk manager of record for several of the largest DeFi protocols, including Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO (now rebranded as Sky). Gauntlet's workflow is distinctive: they analyze protocol parameters, run simulations to determine safe ranges, and then submit their recommendations as on-chain governance proposals that token holders vote on. This creates an unusual dynamic where a risk management firm's analysis is publicly visible and subject to community approval rather than being implemented behind closed doors. Gauntlet has recently begun expanding beyond DeFi into traditional finance risk modeling, which suggests the simulation techniques they've developed on-chain have applicability to conventional portfolio risk.\n\n**Chaos Labs** competes directly with Gauntlet in the economic security space. They've built a simulation engine focused on modeling protocol behavior under extreme market conditions and work with Aave, dYdX, and Osmosis among others. Chaos Labs also provides real-time monitoring and alerting, which addresses a gap in the pure simulation approach: simulations tell you how to set parameters before stress occurs, but real-time monitoring tells you when actual market conditions are approaching the boundaries of your tested scenarios. The combination of pre-deployment simulation and live monitoring creates a more complete risk management practice.\n\n**Risk Harbor** takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than analyzing or simulating risk, Risk Harbor provides parametric coverage, which is closer to insurance than risk management. Their products pay out automatically when specific on-chain events occur: a smart contract exploit that drains funds, a stablecoin depeg below a defined threshold. There's no claims process and no discretionary assessment; the trigger conditions are defined in advance, and payouts execute programmatically. This is risk transfer rather than risk analysis, and it serves a different function in the stack. A protocol might use Gauntlet for parameter optimization and Risk Harbor for residual risk coverage.\n\n**Chainalysis** operates at a broader scope. The firm is primarily known for blockchain analytics and transaction monitoring, but their risk scoring of DeFi protocols and wallet addresses feeds into the risk management ecosystem. When a traditional financial institution evaluates exposure to DeFi (whether through custody, lending, or direct protocol interaction), Chainalysis risk scores help quantify the compliance and counterparty risk associated with specific protocols and addresses.\n\nFor a full view of companies operating at the intersection of crypto and risk management, the [AIFI crypto segment directory](/directory?segment=crypto) tracks firms across DeFi infrastructure, analytics, and security.\n\n## Where on-chain AI agents fit\n\nThere's an emerging intersection between DeFi risk management and autonomous AI agents that I think deserves attention, even though it's still early.\n\nAs DeFi protocols grow in complexity and total value locked (TVL), more operational functions are being handled by autonomous agents rather than human operators. Liquidation bots have existed for years, but the newer generation of on-chain agents handles more complex tasks: rebalancing yield strategies across multiple protocols, executing governance votes based on predefined criteria, managing treasury diversification, and monitoring cross-chain bridge flows.\n\nThese agents need real-time risk assessment to operate safely. An autonomous agent managing a $50 million yield strategy can't wait for a weekly risk report; it needs to evaluate protocol health, market conditions, and exposure concentrations on a per-transaction basis. This is where the simulation platforms and the agentic AI movement converge. The risk models produced by firms like Gauntlet and Chaos Labs could feed directly into agent decision-making frameworks, allowing autonomous capital allocation that respects quantified risk boundaries.\n\nThe [AIFI agent registry](/agents) tracks several agents operating in DeFi contexts, and I expect this category to grow as the infrastructure for on-chain agent coordination matures. The EIP-8004 standard for agent registration is one signal that the ecosystem is moving toward structured, verifiable agent identity, which is a prerequisite for agents to interact with risk management systems in a trustworthy way.\n\n## Institutional capital brings institutional expectations\n\nDeFi TVL recovered to over $90 billion in early 2025, and the composition of that capital has shifted. Early DeFi participants were retail users and crypto-native funds with high risk tolerance. The newer cohort includes traditional asset managers, corporate treasuries, and in some jurisdictions, regulated financial institutions testing on-chain operations.\n\nThese participants bring expectations shaped by decades of traditional finance risk management. They expect Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations, stress testing under defined scenarios, documented risk limits, and independent risk assessment. They're accustomed to regulatory frameworks like Basel III that prescribe capital requirements based on quantified risk exposures.\n\nAdapting these frameworks to on-chain protocols isn't straightforward. VaR assumes continuous price distributions, but DeFi markets experience discontinuous jumps (oracle updates, MEV-driven price movements) that violate that assumption. Stress testing requires defining plausible worst-case scenarios, but in DeFi, the interaction between protocols through composability creates emergent risks that don't exist in siloed traditional finance. A position that looks safe in isolation might become dangerous when a lending protocol's liquidation cascade affects the DEX where the collateral asset trades.\n\nThe simulation-based approach that Gauntlet and Chaos Labs use is, in my view, better suited to these dynamics than straight adaptations of traditional risk models. Agent-based simulation can capture the composability effects and nonlinear feedback loops that characterize DeFi. But the tooling needs to mature, and the outputs need to be presented in formats that traditional risk managers can interpret and act on.\n\n## Regulatory context remains fragmented\n\nDeFi risk management doesn't operate in a regulatory vacuum, though the rules are still forming. The SEC's position on DeFi has focused primarily on whether protocols constitute securities offerings. The CFTC has taken enforcement actions against DeFi protocols offering derivatives. Neither agency has published specific guidance on risk management standards for DeFi protocols.\n\nIn the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation establishes requirements for crypto-asset service providers, but its applicability to decentralized protocols (as opposed to centralized exchanges) is ambiguous. The UK's FCA has taken a cautious approach, focusing on consumer protection rather than protocol-level risk standards.\n\nWhat seems likely, though I'd hedge this view, is that regulatory expectations for DeFi risk management will increase as institutional participation grows. Protocols that can demonstrate quantified, independently validated risk management practices will have an advantage in attracting institutional capital. Protocols that can't will find themselves limited to retail participation, which may be fine for some but constrains growth for others.\n\n## Looking ahead with appropriate caution\n\nThe DeFi risk management space has matured from \"we did a code audit\" to \"we run continuous agent-based simulations and submit parameter recommendations through governance.\" That's genuine progress. The losses in 2023, while still large in absolute terms, came down from 2022, and the protocols that employed dedicated risk management firms generally performed better during market stress events than those that didn't.\n\nI don't want to overstate the case. The simulation models are imperfect. Novel attack vectors can fall outside the tested scenario space. The economic incentives that drive adversarial behavior in DeFi are strong enough that attackers will continue finding blind spots. And the regulatory environment could shift in ways that reshape or constrain DeFi activity regardless of how good the risk management becomes.\n\nWhat I can say with more confidence is that the demand signal is clear. Protocols competing for capital, particularly institutional capital, need to demonstrate rigorous risk management. The firms building these capabilities have defensible positions based on proprietary simulation infrastructure, protocol relationships, and accumulated modeling expertise. As DeFi TVL grows and the stakes increase, the gap between protocols with and without production-grade risk management will widen. That makes this one of the more durable sub-sectors within the broader crypto and AI intersection."
